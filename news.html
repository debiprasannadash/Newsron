                    <h4>OpenAI's new control AI team, Elon Musk praises China and more</h4>
                    <p>Elon Musk believes China is in a strong position when it comes to the development of artificial intelligence and that the country will be “great at anything it puts its mind to.”  

                        In remarks delivered by video on Thursday to the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, which is being held in Shanghai, the Tesla
                         CEO did not hold back when it came to praising certain aspects of the world's second-largest economy.</p>
                         <p>Musk has significant business interests in China. Tesla sells its electric cars there and runs a major factory in Shanghai. In May, he met with China's Foreign Minister, Qin Gang.

                            In the past, he has praised Chinese automakers, describing them as “most competitive in the world.” In 2020 he said “China rocks, in my opinion.”</p>
